# Overview
The idea of this app is to frame the evolution of neural networks as a series of stories in a timeline, making it engaging and memorable. Each "time period" has a mini-narrative, introducing key breakthroughs or ideas in the context of their era.

# Key Features
* Build your own neural network: Visually construct and customize your own neural network;
* Draw and predict: Draw digits and watch as the MNIST model predicts them in real time;
* Interactive visualizations: Understand the inner workings of neural networks through engaging shader animations.

# Frameworks
* Metal API - for shader rendering;
* CoreML - for the MNIST model;
* SwiftUI line and circle shapes - for neural network node representation.

## Running the SwiftUI Playground

The interactive experience is built as a SwiftUI playground named **Brian**. Follow these steps to run it on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josevalencar/SSC-25.git
   ```
   
2. **Open the Playground:**
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Open the file `Brian.playground` in Xcode.
  
3. **Run the Playground:**
* In Xcode, click the play button at the bottom left of the playground window or go to **Editor > Run Playground.**
* Ensure your Xcode version supports SwiftUI.

4. **Explore and Experiment:**
* Interact with the playground to build and visualize neural networks.
* Modify code snippets to see how changes affect your neural network's behavior.

# Considerations
I want to dedicate this app for my dad, mom, and friends who supported the development, with special thanks to my college professors Guilherme Cestari and Murilo Zanini.
